# CO<sub>_duo_</sub>

* Do you know how the electricity you're using right now was generated?
* Do you know the environmental impact of generating that electricity?
* Do you know how to minimize this environmental impact?

CO<sub>_duo_</sub> can help answer all these questions. It's easy to use, "infographic" interface illustrates the current and forecast demand for electricity, how this electricity will be generated and the environmental impact of this generation. With this information you can then see when is best to use energy-intensive appliances (i.e. washing machines, dish washers, tumble dryers, etc) such that environmental impact is reduced.

## Cross Platform

This project uses the [Uno Platform](https://platform.uno/) to create native applications on multiple platforms from a single - UWP/WinUI - codebase. Here are screen shots of CO<sub>_duo_</sub> running on various devices:

## Dual-screen devices

CO<sub>_duo_</sub> has been designed to capitalize on the opportunities presented by dual-screen devices such as the upcoming Surface Neo & Surface Duo. Below you can see CO<sub>_duo_</sub> running on the Surface Neo and how the app becomes much more usable when both screens are used in tandem (click the image to play in YouTube).
