* Do you know how the electricity you're using right now was generated?
* Do you know the environmental impact of generating that electricity?
* Do you know how to minimize this environmental impact?

CO<sub>_duo_</sub> can help answer all these questions. It's easy to use, "infographic" interface illustrates the current and forecast demand for electricity, how this electricity will be generated and the environmental impact of this generation. With this information you can then see when is best to use energy-intensive appliances (i.e. washing machines, dish washers, tumble dryers, etc) such that environmental impact is reduced.
